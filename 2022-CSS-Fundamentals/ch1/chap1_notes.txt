We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

1-Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
    id,class,type/element,universal,grouping
2-Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
    descendent,child,adjacent sibling,general sibling
3-Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
4-Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
5-Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

------------Specificity Hierarchy---------------

Every CSS selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy.
There are four categories which define the specificity level of a selector:

Inline styles - Example: <h1 style="color: pink;">
IDs - Example: #navbar
Classes, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors - Example: .test, :hover, [href]
Elements and pseudo-elements - Example:1, :before
