The four links states are:
a:link - a normal, unvisited link
a:visited - a link the user has visited
a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it
a:active - a link the moment it is clicked

overflow-wrap
If a word is too long to fit a line, it can overflow outside of the container.
This property is also known as word-wrap , although that is non-standard
(but still works as an alias)
