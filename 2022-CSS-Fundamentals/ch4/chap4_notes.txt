-----------------Fallback Fonts-------------------
However, there are no 100% completely web safe fonts. There is always a chance that a font is not found or is not installed properly.
Therefore, it is very important to always use fallback fonts.
This means that you should add a list of similar "backup fonts" in the font-family property. If the first font does not work, the browser will try the next one, and the next one, and so on. Always end the list with a generic font family name.
