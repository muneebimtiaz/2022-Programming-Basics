Where to use color in CSS rules:
--------------------------------
If a CSS property accepts the <color> data type as a value, it will accept any of the above methods of expressing color. For styling text, use the color, text-shadow and text-decoration-color properties which all accept color as the value or color as part of the value.

For backgrounds, you can set a color as the value for background or background-color. Colors can also be used in gradients, such as linear-gradient. Gradients are a type of image that can be programmatically defined in CSS. Gradients accept two or more colors in any combination of color format, such as hex, rgb or hsl.
Finally, border-color, and outline-color set the color for borders and outlines on your boxes. The box-shadow property also accepts color as one of the values.
